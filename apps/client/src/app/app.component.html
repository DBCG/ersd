            This site provides access to the electronic Reporting and Surveillance Distribution (eRSD) for electronic
            Case Reporting (eCR). The eRSD is used to
            guide triggering and reporting of initial electronic case reports (eICRs) from participating Healthcare
            Organizations and their Electronic Health Records. For
            more information, please visit the <a class="link-primary"

              triggering documentation for EHR implementers</a>.
